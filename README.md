# Double Shear Bolted Connection â€“ Abaqus Modeling (P1.py)

This repository provides a fully documented Abaqus CAE Python script for simulating **double shear bolted connections**. The model is associated with the research titled:

> **"A novel procedure to determinate yield and ultimate load and deformation capacity of Double Shear Bolted connections"**
 note: "Manuscript under preparation; not yet published; DOI pending."

## Features
- Explicit Abaqus CAE modeling of double shear bolted joints
- Symmetry, material plasticity, and surface-to-surface contact with friction
- Fully automated via Python scripting

## Getting Started

### To run the script:
```bash
abaqus cae noGUI=P1.py
